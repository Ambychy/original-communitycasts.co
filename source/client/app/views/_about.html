  <p class="about__paragraph">
    Community Casts is built using a bunch of cool open-source software. The main stack is <a class="about__link" href="http://expressjs.com/">Express</a> (for the server), <a class="about__link" href="https://angularjs.org/">Angular</a> (for the client), and <a class="about__link" href="https://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> (for the database).

  <h1 class="about__heading">Privacy</h1>
  <p class="about__paragraph">
    <span class="about__foo">$ ~</span> Community Casts logs your IP address when you click a screencast. This so we can avoid counting the same view twice for ranking purposes.
