    <span class="about__foo">$ ~</span> Community Casts is <em>the</em> place for developers and designers of all skill levels to find awesome, free educational screencasts about technology and design. It was built by <a class="about__link" href="https://twitter.com/bookercodes">Alex Booker</a> and is 100% <a class="about__link" href="https://github.com/alexbooker/communitycasts.co">open source</a>.
  </p>
  <p class="about__paragraph">
    The <a href="/" class="about__link">home page</a> shows a list of popular screencasts. If you want to view screencasts about a specific topic, click on a topic under the "Learn" header on the left-hand-side menu. At the moment, all screencasts are currated by Alex and his friends. In the near future, you'll be able to submit your favourite screencasts, too. In the mean time, if you want your screencast to feature on the website, you can ping me a link on Twitter <a class="about__link" href="https://twitter.com/bookercodes">@bookercodes</a>.</p>
